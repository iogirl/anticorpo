# anticorpo – conservative.txt
# ============================================================
# Purpose:
# This list reduces passive exposure to organized anti-trans,
# anti-LGBTQ, racist, MAGA, and reactionary propaganda networks.
# It targets institutions, influence hubs, and policy engines,
# not individuals or general platforms.
#
# This is voluntary harm-reduction infrastructure, not censorship.
# ...............................

# --- Bypass Philosophy ...
# This blocklist is NOT carceral.
# It does not exist to control users, punish curiosity,
# or prevent access to information.
#
# It exists to: 
#  • reduce ambient psychological harm
#  • prevent accidental exposure via shared links
#  • slow algorithmic radicalization pipelines
#  • lower background culture-war noise in shared spaces

# Any user may opt out or bypass this list at any time.
# Doing so is a valid personal choice and is respected.
# ...............................

# --- How to Opt Out / Bypass ---

# 3) Use a VPN, Tor Browser, or mobile hotspot, OR
#
# 4) Ask the admin to add a one-off allow exception
#    for a specific domain.
#
# No logs are kept for bypass requests.

#  • porn or adult content
