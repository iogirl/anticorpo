# anticorpo 🏴‍☠️

A DNS blocklist for privacy and freedom.

This list blocks:
- ads
- trackers
- telemetry
- surveillance capitalism infrastructure
- conservative websites that feel harmful or "too much"

It deliberately does NOT block:
- porn
- queer media
- sketchy sites (4chan, etc.)
- most social networks
- payment processors
- streaming services

This is not censorship.
This is a consent firewall.
