## clean.txt

* ads
* trackers
* telemetry
* surveillance capitalism infrastructure

It deliberatley does NOT block:
* porn
* queer media
* sketchy sites (4chan, etc.)
* payment processors
* crypto
* streaming services

## conservative.txt
This list blocks:
- conservative media
- conservative orgs (like heritage foundation)
- some hateful people's websites
- tons of anti-trans and anti-lgbtq websites
- other sites that feel harmful or "too much"

This is a deliberate "consent filter." Add this to your DNS block list to avoid encountering some of these disgusting places on the Internet.

This is not censorship.
This is a consent firewall.
